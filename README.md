# Smoothening-PV-Lab-Data-with-Y-function-ML
Smoothening of Pressure and Volume data obtained from Constant Composition Test using Linear Regression for Machine Learning in Python.   

## About Constant Composition Test
Constant-composition expansion experiments are performed on gas condensates or crude oil to simulate the pressure-volume relations of these hydrocarbon systems. 

### The test is conducted for the purposes of determining:
 * Saturation pressure (bubble-point or dew-point pressure)
 * Isothermal compressibility coefficients of the single-phase fluid in excess of saturation pressure
 * Compressibility factors of the gas phase
 * Total hydrocarbon volume as a function of pressure
